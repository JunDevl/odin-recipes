    <h2>Simple Potato Salad Ingredients</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to create a simple, yet delicious potato salad by yourself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> You'll need two eggs, one boiled (see <a
          href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/213737/kens-perfect-hard-boiled-egg-and-i-mean-perfect/"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to boil an egg</a>) and
        one raw. Depending on the size of the salad, you may need four or six. Keep in mind that you should always
        have
        an
        even number of eggs.</li>
      <li><strong>Cooking Oil:</strong> Used to mix the soft and hard yolks of'em eggs.</li>
      <li><strong>Salt:</strong> We don't want to create a bland salad, do we?</li>
      <li><strong>Boiled Potatoes:</strong> Saying you can make a <em>"potato salad"</em> without a <em>potato</em> is
        the
        same as saying you can fry an <em>egg</em> without an <em>egg</em>!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Extract both of the egg's yolks and put them in a plate or bowl.</li>
      <li>With very little oil, start pouring it on your plate or bowl, and then mix everything
        with a fork. As the texture of the mayonnaise starts to become more consistent and slimy-like, you can
        sparsely
        increase the ammount of oil.</li>
      <li>After you're satisfied with the texture of your mayonnaise, add one or two pinches of salt
        to it.</li>
      <li>Finally, have a bowl of boiled potatoes ready (see <a
          href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-boil-potatoes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how
          to
          boil potatoes</a>), and
        then pour all of
        your
        mayonnaise on it. Mix your salad throughout the entire bowl so the mayonnaise doesn't get concentrated in a
        single
        spot.</li>
    </ol>
